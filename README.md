### Turing School of Software & Design - Module 3 - Personal Project
### By Karina Gonzalez

#### Introduction:
Volunteer Cope is a single-page web app developed for Boys and Girls Club's STEM program coordinator. Having had experience primarily in Ruby/ Ruby on Rails, this project served as a learning opportunity. I was able to dive into learning JavaScript, how to make Ajax calls, and effectively manipulating the DOM.  This provided a thorough understanding of why front-end frameworks like React are particularly useful. Being an app that needs to meet the needs of volunteers at The Boys & Girls Club, it is an on-going project.
